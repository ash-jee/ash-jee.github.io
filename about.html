	<h2>Aishwarya Bhattacharjee</h2>
      
	<p><i>Hi</i>, my name is Aishwarya (Ash) Bhattacharjee.</p>
	<p>I’ve lived most of my life in some of the world’s largest and 
	  most populous cities. Born in Mumbai, I spent a majority of my early years in Bangkok, then completed my high school in Dhaka, and currently reside in New York City. Amidst these strong city roots, the convergence of urban and wild was ever-present in my surroundings. As a child, during the hour’s drive from our apartment in the heart of bustling Bangkok to my father’s factory in the city outskirts, I would stare out at a horizon lined with never ending rice paddies and tall painted storks. Such memories inspired a curiosity of the natural world and passion for conservation that has put me on the path of exploring wildlife and diverse ecosystems ever since.</p>

	<p>I completed my B.Sc. at Rutgers University, where I was an active undergraduate researcher and dedicated myself to the field of ecology and conservation. I’ve enjoyed life-changing field experiences, which have taken me from studying floral evolution in campus parking lots, to following orangutans in the peat swamps of Borneo, and joining an international team of scientists for a rapid biodiversity assessment in the Samoan cloud forests.</p>

	<p>Currently, I’m a PhD candidate at the City University of New York and a National Geographic Explorer, 2019. My research focuses on vertebrate scavenger communities and the human-scavenger relationship across a vast biome gradient in South Asia. Broadly, my research interests include community ecology, macro ecological patterns, biodiversity monitoring, and understanding human-wildlife interactions in the context of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation.
