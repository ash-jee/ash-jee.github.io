								<h3>About me</h3>
								<p>I’ve lived most of my life in some of the world’s largest and most populous cities. Born
								  in Mumbai, I spent a majority of my early years in Bangkok, then completed my high
								  school in Dhaka, and currently reside in New York City. Amidst these strong city roots,
								  the convergence of urban and wild was ever-present in my surroundings. As a child,
								  during the hour’s drive from our apartment in the heart of bustling Bangkok to my
								  father’s factory in the city outskirts, I would stare out at a horizon lined with never
								  ending rice paddies and tall painted storks. It was only when I took my first Ornithology
								  course in college that I recognized my passion for birds (and conservation in general!),
								  which eventually led me to my ecology major. Looking back, I realize that those
								  childhood memories inspired a curiosity of the natural world and passion for conservation
								  that led me on my eventual path of studying wildlife and diverse ecosystems.
								</p>

								<h3>Research Background</h3>
								<p>Previously, I completed by B. Sc. at Rutgers University’s School of Environmental and
								Biological Sciences, where I majored in Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources
								(EENR) with a minor in Biology. At the Rutgers’ EENR department, I was an active
								undergraduate researcher and dedicated myself to the field of ecology and conservation.
								I’ve enjoyed life-changing field experiences, which have taken me from studying floral
								evolution in campus parking lots, to following orangutans in the peat swamps of Borneo,
								and joining an international team of scientists for a rapid biodiversity assessment in the
								Samoan cloud forests. During my internship with UNEP’s Convention on Migratory
								species, where I worked with the avian species team, I was exposed to several projects
								related to international conservation initiatives on bird species of high conservation
								priority. Among these projects, I was introduced to their action plan on the conservation
								of migratory birds of prey in Africa and Eurasia (specifically the prevention of poisoning
								of birds of prey). This introductory experience greatly complimented my eventual
								doctoral research, which focused on vertebrate scavengers in Asia, and specifically
								research on vulture populations that had undergone precipitous declines due to poisoning.
								</p>

								<h3>Research Interests</h3>
								<p>Broadly, my research interests include community ecology, macro ecological patterns,
								  biodiversity monitoring, and understanding human-wildlife interactions in the context of
								  ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Guided by my technical and practical
								  skills in the field of ecology, and my personal passion for wildlife, I aim to contribute
								  towards scientifically and socially informed policy-making, research, and assessments of
								  biodiversity and ecosystem services.
