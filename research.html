							  <h2>Current Research</h2>
							  <p>Recently, the South Asian subcontinent has undergone an “avian scavenger crisis” after
							    experiencing one of the most extreme vulture population declines ever observed,
							    primarily due to indirect poisoning via veterinary pharmaceuticals. Similarly, many large
							    predators such as tigers and wolves, which make up some of the most charismatic
							    animals, are highly extinction-prone. In the context of maintaining critical ecosystem
							    processes, predators contribute to trophic facilitation as they can increase natural carrion
							    availability in the environment and reduce carcass detection times (Wilmers et al. 2003,
							    Selva et al. 2005, Allen et al. 2014, Ripple et al. 2014) . South Asia is home to one of the
							    world’s richest obligate scavenger assemblages. However, most scavenger research has
							    focused on communities in the Americas, Europe and Africa.
							  </p>
							  <p>As a doctoral researcher, I study patterns of distribution and diversity across a vast
							    altitude and biome gradient, and the socio-ecological importance of scavengers’
							    ecosystem services. Specifically, my dissertation has focused on vertebrate scavenger
							    diversity, community structure, the human-scavenger relationship, ecosystem service
							    efficiency and related environmental/anthropogenic drivers in the Chitwan-Annapurna
							    landscape of Central Nepal. In this context, I employ interdisciplinary techniques to
							    survey scavenger guilds and their impact on human communities, which includes camera-
							    trapping, social surveys and avian point counts. My work has been a product of
							    invaluable collaborations/affiliations with local Nepali scientists and conservation
							    officials, as well as international colleagues/collaborators.

							  <h3>Scavenger diversity, community structure, ecosystem service efficiency and related 
							    environmental drivers across a biome and altitudinal gradient</h3>
							  <p><i><b>But why scavengers?</b></i></p>
							  <p>Scavengers provide a critical ecosystem service, as the “nature’s clean up crew”, through
							    the consumption of decaying organic material in our environment. Nepal harbors an
							    incredible diversity of vertebrate scavengers that include small mammals such as
							    mongooses and martens, to canid species like foxes, wolves, including larger mammals
							    like bears and the Bengal tiger - the list goes on! All these species share a common
							    biological function, in scavenging, with varying degrees of contribution and occur across
							    a vast network of communities.
							  </p>
							  <p>Our study area exhibits substantial ecological differences with the areas most frequently
							    sampled in this field, which includes a diverse scavenger guild, distinct biomes and a
							    sharp altitudinal gradient. Hence, we pose a highly topical question regarding the extent
							    to which, distinct and relatively uncharacterized, South Asian scavenger assemblages
							    exhibit similar patterns of community dynamics and species-specific functional
							    contributions as those observed in other regions.
							  </p>
							  <p>Within this research line, I have focused on four main projects:
							    <ol>
							      <li>Characterizing the vertebrate scavenger community across a 4,200 m elevation
								gradient, from lowland rainforests to the Himalayas, and identifying
								environmental drivers of diversity and community structure in this landscape</li>
							      <li>Quantifying the ecosystem service efficiency derived from a network of
								vertebrate scavenger assemblages in South Asia (Central Nepal)</li>
							      <li>Evaluating livestock farmers’ existing knowledge and perceptions of vertebrate
								scavenger species and their consequential benefits or detriments</li>
							      <li>Determining the effects of food availability on the population dynamics of an
								obligate scavenger species, the Bearded Vulture (<i>Gypaetus barbatus</i>) and
								comparing their population abundance between Nepal’s Annapurna Conservation
								Area and the Spanish Pyrenees</li>
							    </ol>
							  </p>
							  <p>Over time, and as I have acquired practical and technical skills in this field through
							    various experiences, I am most interested in interdisciplinary work that involves
							    community or ecosystem-level biodiversity research of ecological patterns and function,
							    evaluation of ecosystem services, and socioecological studies of local ecological
							    knowledge for effective conservation, and informed human-wildlife coexistence.
